# Fractal Geometry in Lean

This is an open ended project for formalizing results in fractal geometry using the open source formal verification software [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) and its mathematics library [mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html).

## Goals
As said, the project is open ended, so there are no clear goals. The following is a list of results I plan on formalizing. The list is in no particular order.

- The existence and uniqueness of limit sets of iterated function systems by Hutchinson [1].
    - The Hausdorff dimension of self similar sets satisfying the open set condition (or strong separation)

- Definition of the Minkowski dimension for sets, and its properties

- Definitions of dimensions of measures, and related results
